          <h2>Chapter I</h2>
          <p>When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt. When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.</p>

    <h1>Vertical Rhythm</h1>
    <p>Just like lines on a piece of notebook paper, vertical rhythm helps us stay organized by using evenly spaced horizontal lines as a guide for our pages. Our vertical rhythm is influenced by the size of our font, margin and line-height.</p>
    <p>There are a few great tools that can be used to achieve good vertical rhythm. <a href="http://www.modularscale.com" target="_blank">The Modular Scale</a> helps us calculate our font sizes and margins. <a href="http://www.basehold.it" target="_blank">Basehold.it</a> provides intructions on how to add a customizable background image that visually allows us to check our vertical rhythm.</p>
